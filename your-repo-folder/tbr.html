    <h2>Top 3 Book Series</h2>
    <div class="book">
      <p><strong>1. All For the Game (by Nora Sakavic) </strong> A delicious portrayal of the found family trope in the most broken of people. </p>

    </div>
    <div class="book">
      <p><strong>2. The Raven Cycle (by Maggie Stiefvater):</strong> Everything magic and teenagers, but with beautiful prose and stunning character building, and the wildest plot points (SPOILERS!: one of them is dead, one of them is a king, one of them dreams reality, one of them is poor, one of them amplifies all this 100x). </p>

    </div>
    <div class="book">
      <p><strong>3. Every Cassandra Clare Series except The Mortal Instruments (...by Cassandra Clare, obviously): </strong> Banger. Just-- nothing misses. Each series is unique and done so well. Un-put-downable for any teenager. </p>

    <h2>Confessions</h2>
    <p>I've read some manga before every major exam this week. Particularly, the Teenage Mercenary (gratituous school children violence but... found family so, iykyk), One Punch Man (a comfort re-read) & Bunny by Mona Awad. I started and finished the Apothecary Diaries 15 hrs before this website assignment was due. Please send help. /j </p>
